> **Mission-Critical Integrity.** Evidentia is a next-generation Digital Evidence Management System (DEMS) architected for the **National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB)**. It bridges the gap between cloud storage accessibility and blockchain-backed immutability.

---

## Technical Vision

Traditional evidence management is plagued by the "Trust Paradox"—how can we prove a file hasn't been modified by its own administrators? Evidentia solves this by generating a **Cryptographic Fingerprint (SHA-256)** at the moment of upload and anchoring it to the **Polygon Blockchain**. 

Even a single-pixel alteration to an image or a one-second cut in a video will cause a verification failure against the immutable on-chain record.

## Key Features

### Cinematic "Bureau" Interface
A high-stakes, brutalist-cyber terminal designed for government intelligence operations.
- **Boot Sequence**: Staggered UI initialization simulating high-security clearance.
- **Glassmorphism**: Sophisticated layering using Tailwind and Framer Motion.

### ⛓️ Immutable Chain of Custody
Every upload is a transaction.
- **Blockchain Anchoring**: Hashes are stored on-chain, ensuring absolute proof of integrity.
- **Forensic Verification**: Real-time comparison between Local Binary, Database Metadata, and Blockchain Records.

### 🔍 Smart Artifact Analysis
- **Dynamic Identification**: Automatic detection of MP4, JPG, PDF, and Archives with specialized iconography.
- **Tamper Glitch Protocol**: Visual "emergency" state triggers when hash discrepancies are detected.

## ⚙️ Development Setup

### 1. Clone & Prerequisite
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yashkoparde/evidentia.git
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
# Supabase
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key

# Blockchain (Polygon)
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x... # Your EvidenceVault Smart Contract
VITE_BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_URL=https://polygon-mainnet.infura.io/v3/...
```

### 3. Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
